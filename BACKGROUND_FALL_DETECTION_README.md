# Background Fall Detection Implementation

## Overview

The background fall detection system has been successfully implemented to allow continuous monitoring of rider safety even when the phone screen is off or the app is running in the background.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Background Fall Detection API (`backgroundFallDetectionAPI.ts`)

- Uses `expo-task-manager` for background processing
- Implements battery-optimized sensor monitoring (10Hz vs 20Hz for foreground)
- Stores fall detection state in AsyncStorage for persistence
- Automatic SMS alerts sent to enabled emergency contacts
- Background fall events are stored and can be reviewed later

### 2. Enhanced Main Fall Detection API (`fallDetectionAPI.ts`)

- Now supports both foreground and background monitoring
- Seamless switching between modes
- Unified configuration management
- Combined fall event reporting (foreground + background)

### 3. UI Updates (`app/(tabs)/map.tsx`)

- Updated fall detection modal to show background monitoring status
- Fall events now display detection source (foreground/background)
- Enhanced fall event logging and display

## Key Features

### ✅ Background Operation

- **Screen Off**: Fall detection continues when screen is turned off
- **App Backgrounded**: Monitoring persists when app is minimized or switched
- **Battery Optimized**: Uses 10Hz sampling rate in background (vs 20Hz foreground)
- **Persistent Storage**: Fall detection state survives app restarts

### ✅ Emergency Response

- **Immediate SMS Alerts**: Sent to all enabled emergency contacts
- **Location Included**: GPS coordinates attached to fall alerts
- **Server + Direct SMS**: Dual SMS system for reliability
- **Background SMS**: Alerts work even from background detection

### ✅ Smart Detection

- **Multi-Sensor**: Combines accelerometer and gyroscope data
- **Configurable Thresholds**: 2.5g acceleration, 5.0 rad/s rotation
- **Recovery Time**: 10-second window to self-recover before alert
- **False Positive Reduction**: Requires sustained impact duration

## Configuration

### Background Monitoring Settings

```typescript
{
  accelerationThreshold: 2.5,     // 2.5g impact threshold
  gyroscopeThreshold: 5.0,        // 5.0 rad/s rotation threshold
  impactDuration: 500,            // 500ms sustained impact
  recoveryTimeout: 10000,         // 10 seconds to recover
  isEnabled: true,
  sensorUpdateInterval: 100       // 10Hz for battery efficiency
}
```

### Data Storage

- **Sensor History**: Last 50 samples in AsyncStorage
- **Fall Events**: Last 10 events stored for review
- **Configuration**: Persistent across app restarts
- **User Context**: User ID stored for SMS alerts

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Functionality Test

1. Start tracking with fall detection enabled
2. Verify both foreground and background monitoring start
3. Check console logs for "Background fall detection started"
4. Use fall detection modal to view current status

### 2. Background Operation Test

1. Start tracking and fall detection
2. Minimize the app or turn off screen
3. Simulate fall (vigorous phone shaking/dropping - be careful!)
4. Verify SMS alerts are sent to emergency contacts
5. Return to app and check fall events in modal

### 3. SMS Alert Test

1. Ensure emergency contacts are configured and enabled
2. Use the test fall detection feature in the modal
3. Verify SMS messages are received by emergency contacts
4. Check that background-detected falls also trigger SMS

### 4. Battery Efficiency Test

1. Monitor battery usage during extended background operation
2. Compare with previous implementation
3. Verify 10Hz sensor sampling in background vs 20Hz foreground

## Permissions Required

### Android

- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - For background processing
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` - For location in background
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` - For GPS during background operation
- `WAKE_LOCK` - To prevent device sleep during monitoring
- `SEND_SMS` - For emergency SMS alerts

### iOS

- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` - Background location
- Background App Refresh - For continued operation
- Motion & Fitness permissions - For sensor access

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Platform Limitations

- **iOS**: Stricter background execution limits
- **Android**: Battery optimization may limit background tasks
- **Sensor Access**: Some devices may limit background sensor access

### 2. Battery Impact

- Background monitoring uses additional battery
- Optimized 10Hz sampling reduces impact
- Users should be informed about battery usage

### 3. Network Requirements

- SMS alerts require cellular connection
- Server SMS requires internet connection
- Direct SMS works without internet

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Background monitoring not starting**

   - Check sensor availability
   - Verify permissions are granted
   - Check AsyncStorage for error logs

2. **SMS alerts not sent**

   - Verify emergency contacts are configured
   - Check enabled status of contacts
   - Test with both server and direct SMS

3. **High battery usage**
   - Monitor sensor update interval
   - Check for proper cleanup on app termination
   - Verify background task termination

### Debugging

- Enable console logging in development
- Check AsyncStorage for stored fall events
- Monitor background task status
- Verify SMS delivery logs

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Machine Learning**: More sophisticated fall detection algorithms
2. **Health Integration**: Connect with HealthKit/Google Fit
3. **Wearable Support**: Integration with smartwatches
4. **Video Recording**: Automatic recording during fall events
5. **Medical Integration**: Direct connection to emergency services

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Adaptive Sampling**: Dynamic sensor frequency based on movement
2. **Predictive Wake**: Anticipate falls before they happen
3. **Edge Processing**: On-device ML for better accuracy
4. **Network Optimization**: Compress and batch sensor data

## Conclusion

The background fall detection system provides comprehensive safety monitoring for equestrian activities. It ensures rider safety through continuous monitoring, reliable emergency response, and battery-optimized operation.

The implementation maintains high accuracy while preserving device performance, making it suitable for real-world riding scenarios where phone screens are typically off and apps are backgrounded.
