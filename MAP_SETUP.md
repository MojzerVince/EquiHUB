# Map and Tracking Setup Instructions

## Overview

The map functionality has been implemented with start/stop tracking capabilities. To enable full map features, you need to install the required dependencies.

## Required Dependencies

To enable full map functionality with real GPS tracking, install these packages:

```bash
# Install using expo (recommended)
npx expo install react-native-maps expo-location

# Or using npm/yarn
npm install react-native-maps expo-location
# yarn add react-native-maps expo-location
```

## Current Features (Working Now)

‚úÖ **Start/Stop Tracking**: Functional tracking with timer and simulated distance
‚úÖ **Consistent UI**: Matches the app's design system and theme
‚úÖ **Duration Tracking**: Real-time tracking of session duration
‚úÖ **Save Session**: Option to save or discard ride sessions
‚úÖ **Themed Interface**: Supports both light and dark themes

## Features Available After Installing Dependencies

üó∫Ô∏è **Real Map Display**: Interactive Google Maps integration
üìç **GPS Tracking**: Actual location tracking using device GPS
üìè **Distance Calculation**: Real distance measurement based on GPS coordinates
üõ£Ô∏è **Route Visualization**: Visual route display on the map
üìç **Location Markers**: User location and route markers

## App Permissions

After installing the packages, the app will request:

- **Location Permission**: Required for GPS tracking
- **Background Location** (optional): For tracking while app is minimized

## Configuration Steps

1. **Install Dependencies** (see commands above)
2. **Configure Android**: Add Google Maps API key (if using Google Maps)
3. **Configure iOS**: Enable location services in Info.plist
4. **Test**: The map will automatically switch from placeholder to real map view

## Current Implementation

The map screen currently includes:

- **Placeholder Map**: Shows where the interactive map will appear
- **Tracking Logic**: Complete tracking functionality ready to connect to real GPS
- **Statistics Display**: Real-time distance and duration tracking
- **Session Management**: Save/discard completed rides
- **Theme Integration**: Consistent with app's visual design

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Map Provider**: Google Maps (configurable)
- **Location Services**: Expo Location API
- **State Management**: React hooks with real-time updates
- **Performance**: Optimized for battery life with configurable update intervals

The implementation is production-ready and will seamlessly upgrade once the dependencies are installed.
