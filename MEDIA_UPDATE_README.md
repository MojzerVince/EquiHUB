# Media Selection & Base64 Storage Update

## Overview

Updated the session sharing functionality to only allow photo selection (no videos) with a single image limit and added base64 storage to the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

- **File**: `migrations/add_image_base64_column.sql`
- **Description**: Added `image_base64` TEXT column to `community_posts` table
- **Action Required**: Run this SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor

### 2. Media Filtering & Selection

- **File**: `app/session-share.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Filtered media items to only show photos (`type === "photo"`)
  - Changed from multiple selection (`string[]`) to single selection (`string | null`)
  - Updated UI to reflect single photo selection
  - Added base64 conversion for selected images

### 3. Base64 Conversion Utility

- **File**: `lib/imageUtils.ts` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - `convertImageToBase64()`: Converts image URI to base64 string
  - `isImageUri()`: Validates if URI is an image
  - `getImageDataUrl()`: Creates data URL from base64

### 4. API Interface Updates

- **Files**:
  - `lib/communityAPI.ts`
  - `lib/supabase.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `image_base64?: string` to `CreatePostData` interface
  - Added `image_base64?: string` to `CommunityPost` interface
  - Updated `createPost()` method to include base64 data

### 5. Dependencies

- **Dependency**: `expo-file-system` (already installed)
- **Purpose**: Required for reading image files as base64

## Key Features

### Single Photo Selection

- Users can now only select one photo (no videos)
- Clear visual feedback for selected photo
- Simplified selection UI with single photo indicator

### Base64 Storage

- Selected photos are automatically converted to base64
- Base64 data is stored in the `image_base64` column
- Fallback to image URL if base64 conversion fails
- No blocking - continues without base64 if conversion fails

### Image Priority

- **Priority Order**: Selected photo > Horse image
- Selected photo takes precedence over default horse image
- Metadata stored in `session_data` for tracking

## Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: If you get an error saying the column already exists, that's fine! It means the database is already updated.

### Option 1: Column Already Exists (You got the error)

If you received the error `column "image_base64" of relation "community_posts" already exists`, the database is already updated and you can skip this step. The column exists and is ready to use.

### Option 2: Column Doesn't Exist Yet

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add the image_base64 column to store base64 encoded images (safe version)
ALTER TABLE public.community_posts
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_base64 TEXT NULL;

-- Add a comment to describe the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.community_posts.image_base64 IS 'Base64 encoded image data for the post';
```

### Verification

To verify the column exists, run:

```sql
-- Check if the image_base64 column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'community_posts' AND column_name = 'image_base64';
```

## UI Changes

### Media Gallery

- Shows only photos (videos filtered out)
- Single selection with clear visual indicators
- Updated hint text: "Tap a photo to include it in your post (photos only)"
- Selected photo gets highlighted with golden border and checkmark

### Selection Feedback

- "1 photo selected" indicator when photo is chosen
- "This photo will be shown as the main image in your post" confirmation
- Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected photos

## Technical Details

### Error Handling

- Base64 conversion failures don't block posting
- Graceful fallback to image URL only
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Performance

- Only converts selected image to base64 (not all images)
- Async conversion with user feedback
- Non-blocking UI during conversion

### Storage Efficiency

- Only one image stored as base64 per post
- Videos eliminated to reduce storage requirements
- Metadata tracking for debugging and analytics

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Photo Selection**: Verify only photos appear in media gallery
2. **Test Single Selection**: Confirm only one photo can be selected at a time
3. **Test Base64 Conversion**: Check that base64 data is stored in database
4. **Test Fallback**: Verify posting works even if base64 conversion fails
5. **Test Database**: Confirm `image_base64` column exists and receives data

## Next Steps

1. Run the database migration
2. Test the updated functionality
3. Monitor base64 storage usage
4. Consider adding image compression if base64 data becomes too large
