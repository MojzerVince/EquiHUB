# Base64 Image Display Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Base64 Images Not Loading**: Posts created with base64 images were not showing the images in the community feed. The community feed was only displaying images from the `image_url` field and ignoring the `image_base64` column.

2. **Session Posts Not Showing Images**: Session posts with images were only showing the horse avatar overlay but not the main post image below the content.

## Solution

Updated the community feed to properly handle and display base64 images for all post types.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Base64 Image Utility Import

**File**: `app/(tabs)/community.tsx`

- Added import for `getImageDataUrl` from `lib/imageUtils`

### 2. Created Helper Function

**Function**: `getBestImageUrl(imageUrl?: string, imageBase64?: string)`

- **Priority**: Base64 images take precedence over regular URLs
- **Logic**: If base64 exists, convert to data URL format; otherwise use image_url
- **Returns**: Properly formatted image URL for React Native Image component

### 3. Updated Post Processing Logic

**Location**: `loadPosts()` function in community.tsx

- Modified post formatting to use `getBestImageUrl()` instead of directly using `dbPost.image_url`
- Added debug logging to track image processing

### 4. Fixed Session Post Image Display

**Issue**: Session posts were not showing main images due to condition `{item.image && !item.sessionData &&`
**Fix**: Changed to `{item.image &&` to show images for both regular and session posts
**Result**: Session posts now show both the session data card AND the main post image

### 5. Image Display Locations

The following locations will now display base64 images:

- **Main post images**: All posts (both regular and session posts)
- **Horse avatar overlays**: Small horse images on session posts
- **Session post context**: All images associated with training sessions

## Technical Details

### Base64 to Data URL Conversion

```typescript
// Before: Only image_url
image: dbPost.image_url;

// After: Base64 priority with fallback
image: getBestImageUrl(dbPost.image_url, dbPost.image_base64);
```

### Data URL Format

Base64 images are converted to: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_string}`

### Priority Logic

1. **First Priority**: `image_base64` (if not null/empty)
2. **Fallback**: `image_url` (if base64 not available)
3. **Final Fallback**: `undefined` (no image to display)

## Debug Logging

Added console logs to track:

- When base64 images are being used
- When regular URLs are being used
- Post processing details (image availability, session data, etc.)

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Create a post with image selection in session sharing
2. Check the community feed
3. The selected image should now appear (from base64 storage)
4. Check browser/debug console for image processing logs

## Impact

- ✅ Session posts with selected photos now display images correctly
- ✅ Base64 images take priority over regular URLs
- ✅ Fallback to regular URLs still works for older posts
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
